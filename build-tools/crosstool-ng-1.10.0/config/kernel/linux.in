      The Linux 2.6.35 tree is a "longterm" maintenance branch.
      
      It is intended to fill the niche for users who are not using distribution
      kernels but want to use a regression-free kernel for a longer time.
      
      Critical bug fixes to later 2.6 releases are often ported to this branch
      which makes 2.6.35 a very useful base for many embedded developers seeking
      stable APIs or those who do not need the latest bleeding edge features.
      
      ... and no, this kernel has not undergone any specific QA testing.

      Now, passing a tarball around is easier than passing a directory, so
